# Technical Choices

This document outlines the key technical decisions made in this project and the rationale behind each choice.

## 1. Programming Language

**Chosen:** TypeScript  
**Reason:** TypeScript offers strong static typing, which helps catch errors during development, improves code quality, and enhances maintainability. Its large community and compatibility with JavaScript make it a solid choice for scalable web applications.

## 2. Framework / Library

**Frontend:** React  
**Reason:** React’s component-based architecture enables reusable UI components and efficient state management. Its virtual DOM improves performance, and its popularity ensures strong community support and a wide range of third-party libraries.

## 3. Deployment

**Chosen:** Vercel  
**Reason:** Vercel provides seamless integration with GitHub and supports automatic deployments on push. It’s optimized for frontend frameworks like React, and offers excellent developer experience with custom domains, fast build times, and easy rollback options.

## 4. Styling

**Chosen:** MUI (Material UI)  
**Reason:** MUI provides a rich set of pre-built React components following Material Design guidelines. Its style-in-JavaScript approach allows for dynamic theming and component-level styling, enabling rapid UI development with a clean and consistent look.
